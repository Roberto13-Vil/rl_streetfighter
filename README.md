# 🎮 RL Street Fighter — Reinforcement Learning with Gym-Retro

This project implements a reinforcement learning agent capable of playing **Street Fighter II** using the **Gym-Retro** environment.  
It provides a full deep RL training pipeline, environment preprocessing, action discretization, reproducible Docker setup, and experiment tracking.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore deep reinforcement learning techniques applied to retro games, focusing on:

- Environment setup via **Gym-Retro**
- Frame preprocessing (grayscaling, resizing, stacking)
- Action space simplification for fighting games
- Deep RL algorithms such as **PPO**, **A2C**, and **DQN**
- Logging with **TensorBoard**
- Model checkpointing and reproducible training

The environment, dependencies, and training scripts are fully containerized with Docker to ensure consistent results across machines.
